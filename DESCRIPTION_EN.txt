Build Water adds placeable water blocks with proper water volume behavior. It integrates with terrain (wet ground and water vegetation), and lets the hoe/cultivator work through water blocks. Config changes apply live without a restart.

Installation:
1) Install BepInExPack for Valheim.
2) Copy BuildWater.dll to BepInEx/plugins/.
3) Launch the game once to generate the config.

Requirements:
- Valheim
- BepInExPack_Valheim

Dependencies:
- denikson-BepInExPack_Valheim
